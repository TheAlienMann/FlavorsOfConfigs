# Different flavors of an app for different targets.

Wouldn't that be great if you could make your app run in different modes?
for instance, a QA or Staging, a Testing, Release mode or any other mode with any specific criteria.
well, here in this little project, I'll show case that.


you just need to follow these steps:

First, you need to create a new configuration, which you can do by going to the Project, then info tab, like in th following screenshot. you would duplicate the one configuration tha is closer to your desired one. For instance you need a configuration for QA, duplicating the Debug would be good choice.
